 <h2 id="skills_header"> A message from me</h2><br>
 
 <p class="paragraph">
 
 Hope this message finds you well. I would like to give you an introduction about myself through this letter.
 I am Sagar Lakhia, a Masters Student in Computer Science at University of Texas at Arlington. I am planning to 
 complete my degree with my majors as Software Engineering and Database Systems. My expected Graduation date is May 2016.
  Currently I’m looking for Full time opportunities related to my area of interests.
I've completed my four semesters which comprised of various different projects. These projects gave me an exposure to
 various different technologies and they helped me develop working in a team as well as an individual. During this period 
 
I was able to learn about different technologies like Java, Python, Android Development, Cloud Computing, Web Technologies 
(JSPs, Servlets, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript), C++ and many more. I also possess the basic knowledge about different Software Design 
Patterns and the agile approach used in Software development.  The whole Masters program at the university helped me gain a deeper 
understanding in all these completely different domains.</p>
<p class="paragraph">When I worked in teams, I learned how brainstorming sessions helped us in solving various bottlenecks.
 I was always curious about how things work in terms of software, which over time helped me apprehend that I'm anxious to 
 learn new concepts. Also, sometimes I've came across downfalls as well, but I take those hardships and use it as a building block
  towards success. As Richard Benson once said “You don’t learn to walk by following rules. You learn by doing, and by falling over”. 
  I’ve learned that not everything is going to come easy and I don’t possess knowledge for everything but what I can guarantee is my dedication
   and hard work towards any work assigned. 
I am sure that with all this knowledge in the field of Computer Science and the aptitude that I possess, I will prove to be a 
valuable asset to the organization I'll work for.
If you have any questions please feel free to contact me either via email or phone number.
