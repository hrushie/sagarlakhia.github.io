   <h2>Hello, My name is Sagar</h2>
  <p class="textfont">Sagar Lakhia, 23 years old, born and brought up in India. I am a passionate Android developer looking for an opportunity to make the world a better place.</p>

  <p class="textfont" style="text-indent:50px;">
I completed my Masters of Science in Computer Science from The University of Texas at Arlington. With a keen interest in Android I landed my first job at
App Partner, Brooklyn, New York. I learned a great deal at this place.
I'm currently looking for full time opportunities as an android developer that will further enhance my knowledge. 

 		
 		
 		During my work I've been closely following and implementing MVP design pattern. It literally makes 
 		code clean and easily understandable. Following proper coding guidelines and writing efficient code has been my mantra to make better apps.
 		Hopefully I'll be able to learn more as opportunities come by.</p>
